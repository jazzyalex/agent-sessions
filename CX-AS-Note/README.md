# CX - AS - Note

This folder is the persistent memory bank for this terminal session.

Use this as the drop-point for your ideas, requirements, copied excerpts, and quick references.

## Structure

- `01-inbox.md`: temporary capture for rough thoughts, snippets, and anything not yet categorized.
- `02-ideas.md`: brainstormed concepts, product thoughts, experiments.
- `03-feature-requests.md`: short FRs and scoped user stories.
- `04-roadmap.md`: status-tracked milestones and execution plan.
- `05-copy-bank.md`: pasted text from other sessions to reuse later.
- `06-qa-notes.md`: question/answer log and context clarifications.
- `07-codebase-answering.md`: distilled references for fast recall while coding.

## Update workflow

- Append items at the top when possible.
- Use a short date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Keep each entry terse and actionable.
- When something is complete, move/update its status in `04-roadmap.md`.

# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Sessions will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Favorites (★):
  - Inline star in Sessions list with context menu (Add/Remove from Favorites)
  - Toolbar toggle “Favorites” filters list (AND with search), persisted across launches
  - Favorites persist via UserDefaults (no schema changes)

### Fixed
- Git Context Inspector now responds to Light/Dark/System theme changes immediately; removed reliance on passing a nil preferredColorScheme which could leave the window stuck after switching to System.
- Analytics window now immediately follows System appearance changes even when not key; listens for effective appearance changes and refreshes its SwiftUI root.
- Analytics: Claude sessions now use a stable logical ID derived from the file’s `sessionId`, preventing one logical session from being split across many files. This normalizes avg session length vs Codex.
- Analytics: Gemini sessions also switch to a stable logical ID from `sessionId` when present; added a one-time database rebuild for Gemini.
 - Analytics: Sessions and Messages totals now honor “Hide zero/low message sessions” prefs (DB path), matching the Sessions list.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-04

### Major Release - Unified Interface & Claude Code Support

Agent Sessions 2.0 is a **complete rewrite** with a unified interface for managing both Codex CLI and Claude Code sessions. This release includes advanced search capabilities, dual usage tracking, and significant performance improvements for large sessions.

### Added

- **Unified window** for Codex + Claude with source toggle (Both / Codex / Claude)
- **Claude Code support**: Full parsing, transcript rendering, unique usage tracking (5h/weekly), and Resume for Claude sessions (Terminal/iTerm, configurable in Preferences)
- **Inline toolbar Search**: Magnifying-glass button expands to search field; Option+Command+F opens and focuses instantly
- **Search progress strip** under sessions table showing phase and counters during two-phase pipeline
- **Context menu action**: "Open Session in Folder" for quick file reveal (works even when Finder hides system files)

### Changed

- **Search v2**: Cancellable, incremental, two-phase pipeline (small files first; large deferred), no preview text, strict source toggle enforcement
- **Default display** for not-yet-loaded sessions shows file size in Msgs column (instead of "Many")
- **Exclude filters** in Preferences now apply instantly (no app reload); "Skip agents.md lines" enabled by default for titles/initial view
- **Titles and transcript start** skip common preambles (agents.md and Claude "Caveat..." blocks); auto-scroll jumps to first conversational line

### Improved

- **Large session performance**: Lazy hydration, off-main parsing, defer-until-needed loading for ≥10 MB logs
- **Unified search UX**: Batch streaming of results, keystrokes cancel immediately, promote-on-open prioritizes clicked large session
- **Focus and keyboard flow**: Inline search auto-focuses on open, collapses when empty on click/tab away; no unexpected focus steals from list
- **Visual polish**: Tighter spacing, aligned usage strips and progress meters

### Fixed

- Prevented Find field from stealing focus when navigating list
- More reliable selection behavior during initial load and when switching rows
- Finder reveal now works for hidden session files

### Documentation

- Updated v2 notes and UI tooltips across Sessions, Transcript, and Preferences
- Clarified behaviors including Transcript vs Terminal and all Find controls

### UI

- Inline search with clear button that cancels search and collapses back to magnifying-glass
- Compact progress line communicates "Scanning small/large … x/y" during searches

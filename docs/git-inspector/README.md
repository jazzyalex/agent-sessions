## 🎯 Quick Summary

### The Answer: Do You Need Git CLI?

**YES, for full value** ✅

- **Historical context**: From session files (no CLI needed)
- **Current state**: Requires git CLI (~50ms)
- **Comparison**: Needs both

**You CAN build historical-only view without CLI, but it's 10% of the value.**

## 📋 What to Give Claude Code

Give these 4 files:
1. `launch_prompt.md` - Main implementation brief
2. `data_sources_breakdown.md` - Technical details
3. `button_specifications.md` - Button behavior specs
4. `inspector_screenshot.html` - Visual reference

The launch prompt includes:
- Clear problem statement
- Architecture (data models, git queries, safety analysis)
- UI components (tooltip + inspector)
- Open questions for you to decide
- Timeline estimate (8-11 days)

## 🔑 Key Decisions You Need to Make

Before giving to Claude Code, decide:

1. **Inspector type:** Sheet (modal) or separate window?
   - Recommended: Sheet for Phase 1, window if users request it

2. **"View Changes" button:** Built-in diff or external tool?
   - Recommended: External tool (Fork/Tower) with Terminal fallback

3. **Remote fetch:** Include "Refresh Remote" button?
   - Recommended: No for MVP (keep it simple, local-only)

4. **Initial scope:** Just Codex or all agents?
   - Recommended: All agents with graceful degradation

## ⚡️ Button Summary

All 6 buttons explained in detail in `button_specifications.md`:

1. **📋 View Changes** - Show git diff (external tool or terminal)
2. **📂 Open Directory** - Open cwd in Finder
3. **🌿 Copy Branch** - Copy branch name to clipboard
4. **🔄 Refresh Status** - Re-query git for latest state
5. **📊 Git Status** - Open Terminal with `git status -vv`
6. **⚠️ Resume Anyway** - Resume with safety confirmation

---

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Week 1:** Phase 1 (Tooltip) - Historical snapshot from session files
2. **Week 2:** Phase 2 (Inspector) - Add current state + comparison
3. **Week 3:** Phase 3 (Polish) - All buttons, error handling, keyboard shortcuts

**MVP can ship after Week 2** with basic functionality working.

## 💡 The Value Proposition

Instead of two separate features (historical OR current), you get ONE feature that shows:
- 📸 What was the git context when session started?
- 🔴 What is it now?
- ⚡️ What changed? Is it safe to resume?

This answers the complete user question: "Can I safely resume this session?"

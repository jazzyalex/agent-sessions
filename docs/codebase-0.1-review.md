# Agent Sessions Codebase Review (v0.1)

This document captures a focused review of the Agent Sessions macOS app (formerly CodexHistory) as of version 0.1, based on the current repository state. It highlights architecture, data flow, key modules, testing and CI coverage, and prioritized recommendations.

## TL;DR
- Purpose: Read‑only, fast viewer for Codex CLI JSONL session logs with search and filters.
- Architecture is clean and modular: streaming parser, resilient decoder, Combine‑driven filtering, SwiftUI views.
- Transcript builder introduces a good separation for plain, ANSI, and attributed outputs, with logical chunk coalescing.
- Tests cover core parsing and transcript behaviors; CI is set up on macOS.
- Improvements: incremental index updates, filesystem watching, more robust error surfacing, lint cleanups, and optional export features.

## High‑Level Architecture

```
Sessions directory
  ↳ JSONLReader (streaming)
     ↳ SessionIndexer.parseLine (tolerant decode per line)
        ↳ Session + [SessionEvent]
           ↳ Combine filters (query/date/model/kinds)
              ↳ View state (EnvironmentObject)
                 ↳ SwiftUI Views (list, transcript, filters, inspector)
```

- Data source: per‑session JSON Lines files named `rollout-*.jsonl` under `$CODEX_HOME/sessions` or `~/.codex/sessions`.
- Indexing: `SessionIndexer.refresh()` enumerates the directory, streams files, parses events, and publishes progress and results.
- UI: A split view with a sessions list and a plain transcript detail, plus a search/filters toolbar and preferences pane.
- Export/Styling: `SessionTranscriptBuilder` produces plain/ANSI/attributed transcripts and coalesces streamed chunks for legibility.

## Key Modules

- `Model/`
  - `Session`: Aggregates session metadata and events, and derives helpful fields (shortID, firstUserPreview, gitBranch, grouping helpers).
  - `SessionEvent` + `SessionEventKind`: Represents a single log line; kind derives from `type`/`role` with compatibility mappings.
- `Services/`
  - `SessionIndexer`: Core pipeline for file discovery, parsing, Combine‑based filtering, progress, preferences, and UI signals (find/copy/open raw sheet).
  - `SessionTranscriptBuilder`: Rendering engine for transcripts (plain, ANSI, attributed); performs chunk coalescing and formatting.
  - `TranscriptTheme`: Theme enumeration and color mapping for attributed output.
- `Utilities/`
  - `JSONLReader`: Chunked streaming line reader for large JSONL files.
  - `PrettyJSON`: Best‑effort pretty printer for JSON strings.
- `Views/`
  - `SessionsListView`: Sortable sessions list with metadata columns and Finder/ID context actions.
  - `TranscriptPlainView`: Read‑only monospaced transcript viewer with in‑view find, copy, and a Raw/Pretty sheet.
  - `SearchFiltersView`: Search bar only.
  - `PreferencesView`: Sessions root override + appearance (theme) selection.
  - Additional (not wired in split view by default): `SessionTimelineView`, `EventInspectorView`.
- `AgentSessionsApp.swift`: App entry and window/commands; first‑run prompt if default folder is not readable.

## Data Model and Parsing

- `Session` fields: `id` (SHA‑256 of file path), `startTime`, `endTime`, `model`, `filePath`, `eventCount`, and `events`.
- `gitBranch` detection:
  1) Direct metadata in any event JSON: `git_branch`, `repo.branch`, or `branch`.
  2) Regex over tool outputs (e.g., `git status`, `branch` listings).
- `SessionIndexer.parseLine` is intentionally tolerant:
  - Timestamps: accepts multiple keys (`timestamp`, `time`, `created`, etc.), supports ISO‑8601 (with/without fractions) and numeric epochs (s, ms, µs heuristic).
  - Event kind: from `type` first, then `role`, mapping to `.user`, `.assistant`, `.tool_call`, `.tool_result`, `.error`, `.meta`.
  - Text content: reads `content`/`text`/`message`; if `content` is an array of parts, concatenates text.
  - Tool info: tool name from `tool`/`name`/`function.name`; `arguments` as string or any JSON (stringified); outputs from `stdout`, `stderr`, `result`, `output` with stable ordering and pretty JSON fallback.
  - Streaming indicators: respects `message_id`/`parent_id` and `delta`/`chunk` flags to mark `isDelta`.

## Transcript Rendering

- Outputs:
  - Plain terminal: header + rule + lines, minimal decoration; respects `showTimestamps` and `showMeta`.
  - ANSI: colorized prefixes/timestamps for terminal export.
  - Attributed: monospaced styled text with theme colors for UI display.
- Coalescing:
  - Groups `.assistant` and `.tool_result` events by matching `messageID` or, if missing, heuristics for delta chunks (tool output by tool name).
  - Merges text preserving the first timestamp; reduces noise from chunked streaming.
- Formatting:
  - Tool call lines render compact one‑line JSON arguments (sorted keys) truncated to a max length.
  - Tool outputs pretty‑print JSON payloads; large outputs are not truncated per tests.

## Search and Filters

- `Filters`: query and selected kinds (set of `SessionEventKind`), with kind selection moved to Preferences; default includes all kinds.
- `FilterEngine`:
  - Date/model filtering removed in current UI to reduce clutter; kind filtering is available in Preferences.
  - Full‑text matches across `text`, `toolInput`, `toolOutput`, and raw JSON (case‑insensitive substring).
  - Sorts sessions by start time descending.
- Combine pipeline debounces query and reacts to filters and `allSessions` changes to produce `sessions` for the UI.

## UI and UX

- Split view: Sidebar sessions list + transcript detail.
- Toolbar: Search/filters, refresh, sidebar toggle, preferences.
- Keyboard commands: Refresh (Cmd‑R), Copy Transcript (Cmd‑Shift‑C), Find in Transcript (Cmd‑F). Default Copy (Cmd‑C) now copies only the selected text in the transcript view.
- First run: Prompts for a sessions directory if default isn’t accessible; also configurable under Preferences.
- Detail view: In‑view find with match count and navigation; optional Raw/Pretty whole‑session sheet for inspection.

## Performance and Reliability

- Streaming reader (`JSONLReader`) avoids loading entire files into memory.
- Parsing and filtering utilize background queues and publish updates on the main thread.
- Index refresh updates `allSessions` incrementally per file, keeping UI responsive.
- Heuristics make decoding resilient to schema drift without breaking the viewer.

Potential future improvements:
- File system watching for live updates (e.g., `FSEventStream`), plus cancelable/async indexing.
- Incremental parse: store per‑file offsets to avoid re‑parsing unchanged portions.
- Backpressure or batching UI updates to reduce main‑thread churn for very large corpora.

## Error Handling and UX Feedback

- Progress: `isIndexing`, `progressText`, and per‑file counters are exposed; the toolbar reflects busy state.
- Silent failures: parsing falls back to `rawJSON` text but does not surface structured parse errors. Consider surfacing a non‑intrusive error count and offering a raw preview entry.

## Security & Privacy

- Local‑only: No network access required for indexing or viewing.
- Reads logs from user’s machine; no writes to session files.
- Consider a “sensitive content hide/show” toggle (mentioned as out of scope in README) and a quick‑mask for screenshots.

## Testing and CI

- Unit tests:
  - `SessionParserTests`: JSONL streaming, event decoding, session metadata, filters.
  - `TranscriptBuilderTests`: concatenation of assistant content arrays, pretty‑printed tool outputs, chunk coalescing, no truncation for long output, timestamp toggles, determinism.
- CI: GitHub Actions on `macos-latest` builds and runs tests; uses `xcpretty`; uploads DiagnosticReports on failure.

Recommendations:
- Expand test fixtures to include edge cases (missing timestamps, nested tool outputs, mixed newline encodings, extremely large files).
- Add tests for `gitBranch` extraction regexes.

## Lint and Style

- SwiftLint configuration is present. The captured `lint-xcode.txt` flags issues such as:
  - Optional Data → String conversion style in `PrettyJSON`.
  - Trailing newline and line length occurrences.
  - Identifier naming warnings (e.g., short variable names and snake_case enum cases like `tool_call`, `tool_result`).
  - Cyclomatic complexity warning in `SessionEventKind.from(role:type:)`.

Notes:
- Some naming choices are deliberate for log fidelity (e.g., snake_case for kind values). If desired, keep snake_case as raw values but expose Swift‑style computed properties for UI labels.
- Tackle high‑signal lint items first (formatting, optional conversion, complexity split).

## Known Limitations (aligned with README)

- Export to Markdown/JSONL not implemented (ANSI output exists as a string builder; a save/export option would be straightforward).
- Sensitive content masking toggle not implemented.
- Not a live session client; this is intentionally read‑only.

## Prioritized Recommendations

1) Integrate file system watching for auto‑refresh and add a cancel token for `refresh()`.
2) Add an “Export” action (ANSI and Markdown) and a “Copy ANSI” command.
3) Wire in `SessionTimelineView` and `EventInspectorView` behind a toggle or secondary pane.
4) Surface parse error stats non‑intrusively (e.g., in progress text or a status badge).
5) Address the top lint findings and split complex methods (e.g., refactor `parseLine` sections and kind derivation).
6) Consider grouping sessions by day sections in the sidebar using the provided `groupedBySection` helper.

## Build & Run

- Xcode: Open `Agent Sessions.xcodeproj` and run the `Agent Sessions` scheme.
- CLI tests:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -project Agent Sessions.xcodeproj -scheme Agent Sessions -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test
  ```

## Recent Changes (since initial MVP commit)

- Commit `e451271`:
  - Added `SessionTranscriptBuilder` (plain/ANSI/attributed) with chunk coalescing and timestamp/meta toggles.
  - Added `TranscriptPlainView` (find, copy, raw/pretty sheet) and `TranscriptTheme`.
  - Enhanced parsing in `SessionIndexer` (timestamp keys, tool IO pretty‑print, delta/message IDs).
  - Improved filters and toolbar wiring; added tests (`TranscriptBuilderTests`) and fixture (`session_branch.jsonl`).
  - Updated README and Xcode project files.

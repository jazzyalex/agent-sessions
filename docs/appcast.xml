<h2>What&#x27;s New in 2.11.1</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Session view UI polish: Real user prompts now use the same narrative font as other blocks, remove side accent strips, keep inverted contrast in dark mode, and use a dark gray (`white: 0.20`) bubble with white text in light mode.</li>
<li>Session view UI polish: Removed the synthetic “Conversation starts here” divider line, and the Images toolbar pill now shows icon + count while remaining visible/disabled until images are detected.</li>
<li>CPU spikes optimization: Global Search now stays on fast indexed results while typing (Return still triggers deep scan), reducing long CPU bursts during active search.</li>
<li>Onboarding: Added a visible “Help improve Agent Sessions” feedback card on the first slide (below session/agent counters) that links to the short feedback form and clarifies that Agent Sessions is local-only with no telemetry.</li>
<li>Sessions/Search: Gemini, Copilot, Droid, and OpenClaw indexing now use the same power-aware idle execution profiles as Codex/Claude (lower-priority slices and deferred non-critical work on battery/background).</li>
<li>Sessions/Search: Global Search no longer generates transcripts on-demand during scans; it searches cached transcripts when available and otherwise falls back to raw event fields to avoid multi-minute CPU bursts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Onboarding: Fixed overlap in the “Sessions by Agent” weekly chart, split usage limit tracking into separate Claude/Codex cards, and removed onboarding slide scrolling by fitting all slides within the onboarding window.</li>
<li>Preferences: Added an OpenClaw pane after the other agent panes with Binary Source and Sessions Directory controls, matching the other CLI agent preference sections.</li>
<li>Preferences: Added a sidebar divider between Droid and OpenClaw, and added per-agent `Update...` actions that detect install manager, check latest versions, and run updates with confirmation.</li>
<li>Preferences: Improved per-agent `Update...` detection to resolve package-manager binaries from common PATH locations and infer npm package names from the installed binary path (fixes false &quot;manager not detected&quot; and OpenClaw package-name mismatches).</li>
<li>Sessions/Indexing: Codex and Claude transcript prewarm runs now cancel previous runs and cap per-refresh work to reduce sustained post-refresh energy spikes.</li>
<li>Sessions/Indexing: Non-manual refresh work is deferred while the app is inactive and replays on foreground activation to avoid background energy warnings.</li>
<li>Codex Usage: Automatic tmux `/status` fallback probes now run with stricter stale/no-recent gates, longer cooldown, and lighter file-tail scans to reduce background energy spikes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reminder: What You Got in 2.11</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenClaw sessions: Added OpenClaw (clawdbot) session support, including Advanced visibility for deleted transcripts.</li>
<li>Images: Expanded image workflows across both Session view (inline thumbnails) and Image Browser (cross-agent browsing, filters, and actions).</li>
<li>Search completeness: Reduced missing/incomplete search results for some sessions with incremental changed-file indexing, search backfill paths, and stale-row cleanup.</li>
<li>Energy spikes: Reduced Energy Warning spikes by replacing always-on idle refresh with app-activation/event-driven behavior and power-aware probing/indexing cadence.</li>
</ul>

                <h2>What's New in 2.8</h2>

🦃 **My thanks to the OpenCode community - Agent Sessions now supports OpenCode!** (Resume and usage tracking are on the roadmap.)

<h3>Added</h3>
<p>**OpenCode Support**: Full session browser integration with Claude Code OpenCode sessions, including transcript viewing, analytics, and favorites. Sessions appear in the unified list with source filtering.</p>
<p>Preferences → Claude Code: Sessions Directory override to choose a custom Claude sessions root. The Claude indexer honors this path and refreshes automatically when changed. Defaults to `~/.claude` when unset.</p>
<p>Preferences → Usage Probes: New dedicated pane consolidating Claude and Codex terminal probe settings (auto-probe, cleanup, and one‑click delete), with clear safety messaging.</p>

<h3>Changed</h3>
<p>Preferences → Usage Tracking: Simplified and HIG‑aligned. Added per‑agent master toggles (Enable Codex tracking, Enable Claude tracking) independent of strip/menu bar visibility. Moved all probe controls into the new Usage Probes pane. Reduced vertical scrolling and clarified refresh interval and strip options.</p>
<p>Usage Tracking: Separate refresh intervals per agent. Codex offers 1/5/15 minutes (default 5m). Claude now offers 3/15/30 minutes (default 15m) and `/usage` probes no longer send user messages, so they don't consume tokens.</p>
<p>Usage probes run directly on their configured cadence. The legacy `UsageProbeGate` visibility/budget guard has been removed so Claude and Codex refreshers no longer stall after 24 attempts.</p>
<p>Website: Updated Open Graph and Twitter Card tags to use the `AS-social-media.png` preview so shared links render the large social image correctly.</p>

<h3>Fixed</h3>
<p>Usage Probes: Codex and Claude cleanup actions once again emit status notifications for disabled/unsafe exits and successfully delete Codex probe sessions that log their working directory inside nested payload data.</p>
<p>Usage (Codex): Stale indicator now reflects the age of the last rate‑limit capture only. Recent UI refreshes or token‑only events no longer mask outdated reset times; the strip/menu will show "Stale data" until fresh `rate_limits` arrive.</p>
<p>Claude Usage: Added a central probe gate that suppresses `/usage` probes when the menu bar limits are off and the main window isn't visible, or when the screen is inactive (sleep/screensaver/locked).</p>
<p>Claude Usage Probes: Cleanup now verifies every session file's `cwd/project` matches the dedicated probe working directory, requires tiny (≤5 event) user/assistant-only transcripts, and aborts deletion when uncertain.</p>

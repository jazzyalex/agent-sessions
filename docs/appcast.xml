                <h2>What's New in 2.10.2</h2>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<p>OpenCode: Auto-detection now works for npm-installed CLIs and checks common pip/pipx install locations on macOS (including `~/Library/Python/*/bin`).</p>
<p>Filters: “Hide 1–2 message sessions” no longer hides 0-message sessions when “Hide 0-message sessions” is off.</p>
<p>Onboarding: “Sessions Found” counts now reflect current filter settings; filter labels are now consistently “Hide …”.</p>
<p>Claude probes: Auto-delete now removes failed/empty probe sessions, not just successful ones.</p>
<p>Claude probes: Cleanup now requires validated probe evidence (marker or content) before deleting a project, and cleanup messaging is clearer about protecting normal sessions.</p>
<p>Usage Tracking: Disabling Codex/Claude tracking now also disables their probes/refresh actions and hides them from the menu bar.</p>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<p>Transcript: Tool calls and outputs now render as readable text blocks (commands, paths, stdout, stderr) instead of JSON wrappers.</p>
<p>Transcript: Tool call/output navigation now groups paired blocks, tool outputs no longer repeat the tool label, and tool/error blocks have consistent padding.</p>
<p>Layout: New installs default to the vertical split layout.</p>
<p>Onboarding: The tour now opens in a standard window with a close button.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): User prompts no longer use semibold text; emphasis comes from the accent strip.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Accent strips now align to their block padding.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Block accents no longer bleed into inter-block spacing.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Accent strips now sit outside text bounds.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): User prompts use the base system font size with matching left/right accent strips; the system preamble keeps a single left strip.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Reduced the user prompt Optima font size bump from +2pt to +1pt.</p>
<p>Preferences (Usage Probes): Moved “Show system probe sessions for debugging” to the bottom of the pane.</p>
<p>Onboarding: Onboarding counts now use the system font.
</p>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>Apple Notes-style Unified Search across all sessions and inside a session, compatible with filters.</p>
<p>SQLite-backed search plus richer instant indexing for faster results and better recall.</p>
<p>Incremental analytics refresh and faster startup with immediate hydrated lists.</p>
<p>Session view (formerly Color view) is now a colored timeline with improved formatting.</p>
<p>Unified Search navigation and local Find are more consistent and responsive.</p>
<p>Cockpit-style status UI and refreshed session list typography with live counts.</p>
<p>Onboarding tour refreshed and always shows supported agents.</p>

<h3>Major Changes</h3>

<p>Search: Unified Search is now Apple Notes-style: fast across all sessions, within a specific session, and compatible with all filters.</p>
<p>Search: Use SQLite full-text indexing to speed up global search after analytics indexing completes.</p>
<p>Search: Instant search now indexes full tool inputs and outputs for recent sessions (last 90 days), reducing the need to wait for background scanning.</p>
<p>Search: Tool output indexing now redacts embedded base64/data URL blobs to keep search responsive and the index compact.</p>
<p>Search: Instant search now uses token-prefix matching by default (for example, `magic` behaves like `magic*`) to improve identifier and structured-text recall without trigram/substr indexing.</p>
<p>Search: Background scanning of large tool outputs is now opt-in by default, keeping Instant search more responsive (Settings → Advanced).</p>
<p>Search: Instant indexing now samples long assistant messages and tool inputs (head + middle + tail) to reduce false negatives without indexing the full transcript.</p>
<p>Search: Instant indexing now captures more of long tool outputs (head + middle + tail slices) and keeps active Codex sessions searchable while they are updating.</p>
<p>Search: Multi-word Unified Search queries now behave like phrase searches (for example, `exit code`) to match transcript navigation and avoid accidental boolean parsing.</p>
<p>Search: Unified Search highlights now use token-phrase matching across punctuation/newlines, and Session view reports visible vs total match counts when role filters are active.</p>
<p>Search: Global search now accepts quoted `repo:` and `path:` filters, and background deep scans run at low priority with on-demand prewarming for opened sessions.</p>
<p>Search: The Search Sessions menu item and ⌥⌘F shortcut now reliably focus the global search field.</p>
<p>Search: Unified Search highlights matches in the selected transcript and jumps to the first match when switching sessions.</p>
<p>Indexing: Analytics refresh is now incremental (skips unchanged files and removes deleted ones) to reduce startup work and keep search data current.</p>
<p>Startup: When Codex sessions are already indexed, the app now shows the hydrated list immediately while scanning for newly created sessions in the background.</p>
<p>Transcript: Replace the read-only search box with a Unified Search navigation pill that appears only when Unified Search has a free-text query.</p>
<p>Transcript: Find in Transcript (⌘F) now opens a local find bar with its own query and navigation.</p>
<p>Transcript: Unified Search now auto-jumps to the first match after typing or switching sessions, and local Find uses a solid blue current-match marker aligned with the match.</p>
<p>Transcript: Session view now auto-scrolls to the last user prompt by default, with a Unified Window setting to choose first vs last user prompt.</p>
<p>Transcript: Color view is now called Session view and presents a colored timeline with improved formatting.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Use system font for narrative blocks; keep tool call blocks monospaced.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Blocks now render as rounded cards with subtle tints and left accent borders.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): User prompts now use a thicker accent rail, slightly brighter tint, and semibold first-line text for readability.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Assistant blocks now use per-agent brand tints and the role legend matches transcript accents.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Find highlights now mark matched substrings and add a line indicator for easier scanning.</p>
<p>UI: Consolidate unified-window status indicators into a single cockpit-style footer.</p>
<p>UI: In dark mode, the cockpit footer now uses a transparent HUD style with crisp borders instead of a solid fill.</p>
<p>UI: Menu bar usage now uses the same monospace, logo-forward cockpit styling as the footer.</p>
<p>UI: Persist split-view divider positions per layout mode (horizontal vs vertical) so switching layouts doesn’t reset pane sizes.</p>
<p>UI: Session list typography now uses monospaced text with softer timestamp gray, taller rows, lighter message counts, and footer-blue selection accents.</p>
<p>UI: Increase session list row height to 48px for easier scanning.</p>
<p>UI: Codex now uses a blue brand accent distinct from the cockpit footer tint; the transcript toolbar spacing is tighter, and the terminal view adds a subtle top border.</p>
<p>Onboarding: Replaced the onboarding flow with a four-slide tour covering sessions, agent enablement, workflow tips, and usage tracking.</p>
<p>Onboarding: Show all supported agents and discovered sessions in the tour regardless of Sessions toolbar filters; disabled agents appear as inactive.</p>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>

<p>Onboarding: Refine tour icon and primary button colors to better match native macOS accents.</p>
<p>Sessions: Hide housekeeping-only sessions (no assistant output and no real prompt content) by default; use “Show housekeeping-only sessions” in Settings → General to reveal them.</p>
<p>Sessions: Show a live session count in the unified list that updates while indexing and when filters/search change.</p>
<p>Preferences: The Menu Bar pane now groups label options into sections and aligns toggles consistently.</p>
<p>Transcript: Removed the duplicate Jump to First Prompt control from the transcript toolbar.</p>
<p>Sessions list: The Size column can now be sorted.</p>
<p>Search: Tooltips now include keyboard shortcuts for search fields and navigation arrows.</p>
<p>Analytics: The By Agent card now auto-scales rows and falls back to an internal scroll when space is tight.</p>
<p>Menu Bar: Reset menu items now include weekday; menu bar label can hide reset indicators per provider.</p>
<p>Menu Bar: Removed pill backgrounds from the menu bar label for a cleaner, more native look.</p>
<p>Usage: Time-only reset strings now roll forward to the next day to avoid showing stale "<1m" countdowns.</p>
<p>Transcript: Toolbar controls now use monospaced typography to match the session list.</p>
<p>Sessions list: Added a context menu action to copy the session ID to the clipboard.</p>
<p>Sessions: Resume context menu actions now include the selected terminal app (for example, Terminal or iTerm2).</p>

<h3>Critical Fixes</h3>

<p>Search: Prevent missing results while the search index is still warming by falling back to legacy matching for unindexed sessions.</p>
<p>Search: Backfill missing per-session search data during incremental refresh so sessions don’t remain “not yet indexed” indefinitely.</p>
<p>Search: Claude sessions now keep transcript match highlights in sync with the active search query.</p>
<p>Transcript: Remove the ghost control inside the Unified Search navigation pill.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Match counts now update when Unified Search is active.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Search markers now appear only on matching wrapped lines and replace the block accent for that line.</p>
<p>Sessions: Auto-select the first session on launch so the transcript pane isn’t blank.</p>
<p>Sessions: Stabilize message counts for large sessions while full parsing completes to reduce list row jumps.</p>
<p>Copilot: Normalize tool output newlines when logs include escaped `
` sequences.</p>
<p>Parsing: Preserve non-zero exit codes in Gemini/OpenCode tool outputs and classify them as errors for error navigation.</p>
<p>Parsing: Droid stream-json now handles numeric timestamps, tool call IDs, and error flags in tool results.</p>
<p>Parsing: Treat Claude Code `queue-operation` and `file-history-snapshot` events as metadata so new versions don’t pollute transcripts or inflate message counts.</p>
<p>Parsing: Gemini sessions now account for `model`/`tokens`/`thoughts` fields in newer chat logs.</p>
<p>Parsing: Treat Copilot `assistant.turn_start/end`, `tool.execution_start`, and `session.truncation` events as metadata so they don’t clutter transcripts.</p>
<p>Transcript: Clearing Find now immediately clears match highlights.</p>
<p>Transcript: Terminal view no longer leaves a stale find highlight when the Find query is empty.</p>
<p>Transcript: Toolbar filters now use dot + count labels with compact navigation chevrons.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Render Codex review blocks as labeled Review meta entries instead of user prompts.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Split system reminder and local-command caveat blocks into meta lines so user prompts stay visible.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Treat Claude local-command tag-only blocks as Local Command meta lines.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Local Command meta blocks now render with a thin blue accent strip.</p>
<p>Transcript (Session view): Request interrupted-by-user markers now use a thin blue strip and regular text.</p>
<p>Parsing: Ignore empty JSONL lines during scanning for improved robustness.</p>
<p>Parsing: Surface Codex thread rollback events with readable text in timelines.</p>
<p>Claude: Avoid UI stalls when opening sessions with embedded base64 blobs (for example, Chrome MCP screenshots).</p>
<p>Claude Usage: Detect the Claude Code first-run terms prompt and surface a “Setup required” state instead of timing out silently.</p>
<p>Toolbar: Keep action icons visible and overflow actions accessible when a project filter is active.</p>
<p>Toolbar: Refined agent tabs and icon groups, updated the layout/theme controls, and tightened toolbar button sizing and hover states.</p>
<p>UI: Update Codex and Claude brand accents to blue and warm brown for clearer agent recognition.</p>
<p>Transcript: Rename view mode buttons to Session/Text/JSON, align them with HIG-style leading padding, and space the session ID control.</p>
<p>Menu Bar: When usage data is stale, reset indicators now show “n/a” instead of an incorrect countdown.</p>
<p>Claude Usage: Refresh usage automatically after wake when the usage strip or menu bar label is visible.</p>
<p>Menu Bar: Show an updating spinner next to reset indicators while probes run.</p>
<p>Search: Unified Search now accepts quoted repo/path filters with spaces.</p>
<p>Claude/Codex Usage: Add a conservative startup sweep for probe tmux servers and harden cleanup/timeouts to avoid orphaned CLI processes after stalled probes or restarts.</p>

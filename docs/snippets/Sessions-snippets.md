Curated prompts and commands related to DMG/packaging from sessions that mention Agent Sessions. Review and prune.

## Excerpts
- **Verifying DEFINES_MODULE in relea e build**
- **Preparing relea e in pection plan**
- I’m thinking through a careful plan to review the repo before relea e. Thi  include  running SwiftLint, building and te ting with xcodebuild, checking for untracked change , and in pecting for i ue  like a et duplication, all to en ure a  mooth relea e. Next, I’ll formalize the e  tep  u ing the plan tool.
- **Reviewing documentation and relea e plan**
- I’m thinking through a multi- tep approach to in pect the archive’  metadata and app content  for  igning detail . I want to check the Info.pli t for  igning identitie , then explore ne ted framework  and binarie  to run code ign verification on each to identify un igned component . Thi  feel  complex enough to warrant making a clear plan with the e  tep .
- I'll wrap up by detailing the key finding  about the app'  code  igning  tatu , referencing the mi ing Team and SigningIdentity in Info.pli t, the ad-hoc linker  igning flag , the ab ence of a TeamIdentifier and proper code ign  tructure, and the failure of  trict code ign verification due to no actual  ignature pre ent. I'll point out relevant path  and lack of a _CodeSignature directory to give a clear picture.
- **Verifying relea e config and preparing final  ummary**
- **Reque ting notarization detail **
- **Preparing to create  igned DMG**
- I’m outlining a plan to make a  igned DMG from the exported app in the repo root. Fir t, I want to confirm the app path to en ure I target the right file. Since thi  involve  creating directorie  and running command  like hdiutil and code ign, I’ll explain the  tep  carefully and a k permi ion before making any change . I’ll al o clarify which  igning identity to u e and note that notarization might be optional ba ed on the u er’  reque t.
- **Preparing to  ign DMG**
- **Preparing DMG creation plan**
- I’m outlining a  tep-by- tep plan to create and  ign a DMG for the app, including making a  taging directory, copying file , u ing hdiutil to create and compre  the DMG, and  igning it with the Developer ID identity. I’ll al o note the need to a k permi ion before running any command  that modify the file y tem and mention an optional  taple  tep, while keeping log  for rollback. Next, I’ll re pond with thi  plan and reque t go-ahead.
- **Checking for create-dmg availability**
- **Evaluating create-dmg in tallation option **
- **De igning DMG creation plan**
- I'm laying out a  tep-by- tep approach to create a  igned DMG: fir t, reque t permi ion to make a  taging folder and copy the app; then run the create-dmg tool with a  imple layout; next, code  ign the DMG; and finally, optionally  taple it. I'll make  ure to log all command  and a k for permi ion before any write operation   ince that align  with the in truction . Let'  propo e thi  plan clearly to the u er.
- **Handling create-dmg failure**
- **Rerunning create-dmg without background**
- **Handling command timeout and checking mounted DMG **
- **Removing remaining rw DMG**
- **Adju ting create-dmg timeout**
- **Signing DMG file**
- I’m putting together a clear  ummary of the DMG creation proce , including path , command  run, and verification  tep . I’ll al o note no notarization wa  done and offer optional next  tep  for that, plu  cleanup tip  and package detail .
- **Advi ing on notarization nece ity**
- **Explaining notarization authentication option **
- I'm preparing clear in truction  for creating an App Store Connect API key with the proper role—typically "App Manager" or "Admin"—needed for notarization via the new notary tool. I'll explain where to create the key,  ugge t a good naming convention like "AgentSe ion NotaryKey," highlight role requirement , and note that the key  hould be downloaded and can be reu ed. Thi   hould help the u er follow be t practice  confidently!
- **Planning DMG upload to GitHub relea e **
- I’m figuring out how to upload the DMG file to GitHub relea e  by checking the repo’  remote and relea e tag . I want to verify if the GitHub CLI i  in talled and decide whether to create a new relea e or upload to an exi ting one, then create a  tep-by- tep plan to handle the e ta k   afely and properly.
- **Clarifying relea e target**
- **Preparing to create GitHub relea e**
- **Searching for relea e note  in README**
- **Preparing relea e  tep  and note **
- I’m figuring out how to handle the current dirty repo  tate for tagging and relea ing, checking if I  hould commit or  ta h change , and planning to create an annotated tag `v1.0` and pu h it before u ing the GitHub CLI to create a relea e. I want to ba e the relea e note  on the README and confirm the DMG file exi t  in the `di t` directory for inclu ion in the relea e.
- **Preparing GitHub relea e note  and tag **
- I'll compo e relea e note  from the README highlight , figure out the be t way to pa  them to the GitHub CLI, and plan creating an annotated git tag and pu hing it, making  ure to handle uncommitted change  properly  ince they might affect what’  included in the relea e.
- **Preparing relea e note  for DMG**
- **Con idering relea e li t verification**
- **Summarizing relea e creation and next  tep **
- I’m putting together a final me age that outline  the relea e creation, DMG  igning and notarization, and uploading. I'll include the relea e URL, note , and new tag info. I’ll al o mention new file  like the DMG in the di t folder and keychain profile , plu   ugge t cleaning up backup  and untracked file . Then, I’ll guide about committing change  and handling the di t folder, including whether to add it to .gitignore or keep the DMG there for future relea e . I want to make thi  clear and actionable with bullet point  and include the Reque t ID for reference.
- I'll wrap up with a clear  ummary highlighting our commit , file change  like in the pbxproj, the removal of the DMG and di t file , and note  on the GitHub relea e. I'll al o add gentle reminder  about pu hing change  and verifying everything,  o the u er ha  an ea y checkli t moving forward.
- **Planning relea e a et link addition**
- **Updating macOS DMG download link**
- **Retrieving late t relea e tag**
- I’m figuring out how to create and manage a temporary directory for downloading the relea e a et, con idering  hell environment per i tence challenge . To keep it  imple and reu able acro  command , I decide to create a known tmp directory in ide the repo at `./tmp/homebrew-agent- e ion ` in tead of u ing `mktemp -d`, which would be ephemeral and harder to reference in later command .
- **Downloading DMG for late t relea e**
- I'm planning to add a bullet to the doc /CHANGELOG under [Unrelea ed] to reflect the removal of kind toggle  and the addition of preference . I'll al o update the  ummary. It’  important to en ure that AGENTS.md i  in line with the  pecification , and it appear  to exi t at the repo itory root a  in tructed by the developer me age. I  hould check the content  of 'agent .md' to en ure it include  all the nece ary in truction .
- I need to add doc /CHANGELOG.md and doc / ummarie /2025-09.md. After that, I’ll commit with trailer . I’m going to prepare apply_patch to add the e two file  and include a note under the [Unrelea ed] bullet. Oh, and I have to check that the doc / ummarie / directory exi t ; apply_patch will create it if not. Alright, I’m ready to implement the e change  now!
- **Planning debug and relea e line  inclu ion**
- I'm looking deeper into the generative warning   een on macOS Sonoma, tracing them to `GenerativeModel .framework` linked to new NSTextCompletion feature  that require entitlement . I want to clarify the e warning   how up in debug and relea e log  but aren’t harmful, and  ugge t way  to verify thi  when di tributing the DMG. I'll document thi  context and plan to draft a clear  ummary next.
- I’m putting together a clear explanation of the warning , referencing the `doc /viewbridge-error .md` document for context and rea oning. I’ll organize it with bullet point  covering each warning, cau e , and  ugge tion  for next  tep  like running the relea e build and noting di claimer  about generative feature  triggering  y tem log . To comply with in truction , I plan to include approximate  tarting line number  by in pecting the doc with line numbering  o the u er can ea ily find relevant info.
- I'll  ummarize key known warning  from doc  and framework , clarify their harmle ne  including generative model log  tied to  y tem framework  on Sonoma, mention Greymatter ent warning  from foundation lib , and outline recommended next  tep  like running a relea e build and documenting the e for QA.
- With Zed, it’  important to reference the relea e note di cu ing the ba e64 encoded image  decoding fix. 
- I'm con idering detailing the log directory path environment variable CODEX_HOME, which fall  back to /.codex/ e ion , a  noted in the README. I  hould al o reference GitHub i ue #2288. We need to add thi  information to a new document and link it in the README. While the playbook  ugge t  that update  aren't required unle  there'  a change in architecture or  chema, I could optionally add a note in the CHANGELOG under "Unrelea ed" about thi   e ion  torage format document. I'll create the new file: doc / e ion- torage-format.md.
- I need to en ure that the commit me age include   pecific trailer line  like "Tool: Codex," "Model: gpt-5-thinking," and "Why: E tabli he  a clear data contract for normalized event ." I al o have to follow the playbook'  requirement to add an ADR if there are change  to the architecture, data  chema, or build, and note it under Unrelea ed in the CHANGELOG. Since there’  no u er-vi ible change, I won’t provide  ummarie  thi  month. I’ll run the nece ary git command  next.
- For our app'  conclu ion, we need to implement our own re ume picker u ing  e ion file  while keeping an eye on the relea e note . It'  okay to reference GitHub a  it'  an official OpenAI domain, and we  hould keep our bullet  conci e for clarity.
- If it  eem  nece ary, I might want to mention that the la t relea e wa  0.34.0 on September 10, 2025, which add   ome context for recency. I can cite the repo itory page  pecifically mentioning thi  information in line L26. With all thi , I’m ready to produce the final me age!
- I'm checking the relea e note  to  ee if they li t merged PR , but I can't find anything about the re ume feature. It might be in an earlier relea e, or maybe it wa  implemented but ju t i n't documented. I think we need to look for the code that actually implement  "re ume." I'll run a  earch on Sourcegraph u ing the query: "repo:openai/codex re ume" to  ee if I can find it there.
- I’ll  tart by acknowledging the u er’  point and apologizing for my earlier mi take. Next, I need to verify the behavior by checking the code for relea e 0.34. Since there are limitation  with GitHub code page , I have two option : they can run 'rg -n "re ume" codex/codex-r  -S' locally, or I can explain the ob erved behavior.
- I’ll  tart with a brief apology for any confu ion before  ummarizing the ob erved behavior. In relea e 0.34, the '--re ume' option open  a picker  howing recent  e ion  from the la t 24 hour  acro  all repo itorie , and it i  not repo- coped. The preview di play  the fir t u er me age, while 'continue' re ume  the mo t recent  e ion. Both option  utilize the 'experimental_re ume' path in the background.
- I've found a relea e note  page that mention  a "Core rollout refactor," which  upport  the idea of a li ting API. However, I need to track down direct code reference . The GitHub i ue 3101 point  to file path  in "codex-r /core/ rc/config.r ," indicating the repo itory i  named "codex-r ." It  eem  the TUI code might be located under "tui/ rc/..." within thi  repo itory. Next, I’ll attempt to open the repo itory tree to inve tigate further.
- I’m having trouble finding code- pecific page  through  earch, and it  eem  GitHub code  earch i n't acce ible to the tool. However, we do have the relea e tarball. I think clicking "Show all 22 a et " could help. I  hould check if "Source code (zip)" option 102 open . We attempted option 103 tar.gz before, but it didn’t work,  o trying option 102  eem  like a rea onable next  tep!
- I  ee that the web tool i  having i ue  with GitHub content, but I can  till acce  the relea e note  page. The u er provided a detailed breakdown, and  ince they have ver ion 0.34 in talled, I can tru t their analy i . When calling the web tool, all  tatement  need citation , and I'll u e the reference  from the relea e note  on 0.29 and 0.34. I think I can phra e my verification ba ed on the  ource file  provided by the u er.
- For con tant  like PAGE_SIZE=25, HEAD_RECORD_LIMIT=10, and MAX_SCAN_FILES=100, I could  ay "From code" but need citation  for anything that might have changed  ince June 2024. Since I can’t acce  the page , I’ll  ugge t that the u er run a local check with "rg -n 're ume' tui/ rc". Al o, becau e we've already called web.run, I  hould avoid additional citation  and ba e my  tatement  on the u er'  information, while  till citing the relea e page for 0.34 and the rollout refactor for 0.29.
- **Exploring relea e note  and doc **
- The reque t i   imply to add a TODO item about modifying the  e ion   earch to  earch in ide the tran cript in tead of raw JSON data by default. While I know that changing u er-vi ible behavior u ually require  documentation update , adding a TODO i n't an implementation change. It  eem  like I  hould document thi  in the doc /CHANGELOG.md under [Unrelea ed]. There doe n’t appear to be an explicit TODO file, but it’  okay to maintain a li t in that format!
- I’m thinking we can add a bullet point in doc /CHANGELOG.md under [Unrelea ed]  aying  omething like, "TODO: Switch  e ion  earch default to tran cript-level (with preference), currently u ing raw JSON." However, I know the guideline  u ually  tate that TODO   houldn’t be included, a  the CHANGELOG i  meant to record change . But maybe they u ed it for TODO  before? I'll definitely need to check out doc /CHANGELOG.md to  ee how it’   tructured!
- I’m con idering whether to add a TODO mention to the doc /CHANGELOG or ju t leave a TODO comment in the code. According to the in truction , I need to write down thi  feature in the to-do li t. The project ha  both doc /CHANGELOG and doc / ummarie  available. I think I’ll add a bullet under Unrelea ed in the CHANGELOG that  ay , “TODO: Add optional raw JSON  earch toggle.” 
- I'm thinking about  ugge tion  for the next  tep . We could add a "Copy re ume command" next to Launch and include "Recent  earch  ugge tion " or "filter by repo/time"  ince they have filter  already. They mentioned "vibe coding po t," but that doe n't  eem relevant right now. Maybe we can propo e adding "Open in iTerm" too. Option  might include pu hing the main branch to origin, cutting a relea e, and adding pinned  e ion  or  aved filter . There’  al o a chance to include keyboard  hortcut  and a "Quick open" feature with cmd+L!
- I’m con idering  ome new de ign feature . Fir t, I think adding a "Copy Command" button next to "Launch" would be really helpful, both in the re ume pane and the context menu. Providing an interactive invocation  tring make   en e too. I  hould remember platform quoting rule  for macOS, e pecially regarding  pace  in path . Al o, copying to NSPa teboard and giving  ucce  feedback  ound  nece ary. Finally, we can draft a  hort blurb for relea e note  or Product Hunt about thi  feature.
- **Drafting DMG build flow in truction **
- I need to provide a draft for a "DMG build flow" demo  cript for a  creen recording aimed at README or Product Hunt. The u er want  to  kip the implementation of the Copy Launch Command and note it a  TODO in tead. I’ll need to write a brief demo  cript on finding or re uming  e ion  where the agent prepare  DMG. Since we're in Plan Mode, I mu t adhere to analy i -only guideline  and outline a  tructured plan with  pecified  ection .
- **Drafting DMG build flow demo**
- The u er a ked me to write a draft for a "DMG build flow" demo. In Plan Mode, if I were to implement anything, I would need to note that it require  leaving Plan Mode. However, creating draft text  eem  to fall under content creation and  hould be allowed. I can produce a demo  cript, a  hot li t for  creen recording, overlay text, and a clear flow u ing the app. Plu , I’ll include a TODO entry for the "Copy Launch Command" in the doc . I  hould keep everything conci e and organized.
- **Planning DMG build flow demo**
- I’m planning to include a one-paragraph intro for the README or Product Hunt. Then, I'll outline the recording goal . Next, I’ll create a  hot li t  toryboard with time tamp  and action . Thi  will involve navigating to the app,  earching for 'DMG', filtering by the repo like 'Agent Se ion  packaging' or 'notarize', and di playing the tran cript view. I will  how the working directory and how to choo e a  e ion to click "Launch in Terminal," where the Terminal open , and I’ll demon trate the action  for re uming and creating the DMG for relea e 1.2.3.
- **Detailing DMG build flow in truction **
- Now, it look  like I need to par e the u er'  local  e ion  directory, but it  eem  reading out ide the work pace i n't allowed. I can't acce  pa t  e ion  directly. However, maybe the "codex-hi tory" project within the repo contain   aved  e ion tran cript . I'll check the AgentSe ion  or doc  directorie  for the 'DMG' or related code  nippet . It’  worth  earching the repo for anything u eful there!
- I’ve realized that we can’t acce  the u er’   e ion   ince they're external. For item 2, I need to a k about con traint  while propo ing a template and a proce  for extracting  nippet . I can  ugge t a curated " tarter li t" of common deployment command  for DMG building, along with relevant code  nippet . 
- I need to be tran parent with the u er that I can't acce  their Codex  e ion  folder. I can offer two option : they can export 2-3 JSONL file , or I could provide a minimal analyzer  cript to run locally for extracting top command  and DMG-related line  into a Markdown li t. 
- I’ll  ugge t a tool called 'Snippet extractor' to build later. For now, I can create 'tool / nippet _from_ e ion .py' and a Ba h  cript to  can  e ion . I’ll al o draft documentation  ummarizing the e option  and provide a  cript to  can for DMG-related item !
- I’ll implement a few update : fir t, I’ll create 'doc /vi ion/agent- e ion -ide.md' with  ection  like Vi ion and Option . Then, I’ll add a 'doc / nippet /README.md' to explain collected  nippet  and provide u eful code block  related to DMG build . La tly, there’ll be a 'tool /extract_codex_ nippet . h'  cript to find DMG-related line !
- The  cript will  et a default SESSIONS_ROOT of "/.codex/ e ion " and u e grep for keyword  like "dmg," "notarize," and other , capturing relevant line  into a Markdown file by  e ion. I’ll al o en ure the  cript can function with or without jq. Let’  proceed with thi  implementation!
- Since many  e ion  are in JSONL format, I’ll employ jq to extract 'text' field  from  pecific line . I’ll filter the output for key pattern  like ‘code ign’ and other  to compile relevant finding !
- It look  like the "u eful command " I extracted are mixed with narrative text and have odd  pacing, indicating that the JSON  tructure i n't very  trict. Thi  led to pulling in irrelevant "text" line . The u er want  logic  imilar to our app,  o I need to  earch "rendered tran cript " for relevant information, focu ing on "DMG" and packaging ta k . Given the time, I  hould compile a Se ion - nippet .md by  canning for  pecific term  acro  the file  and  ummarizing. However, the extraction produced a lot of noi e.
- I’m thinking about how to enhance the extraction with jq to capture only 'tool_input' that are actual  hell command line ,  tarting with  pecific command . I'll refine the extraction for tho e 26 file  to focu  on line  that match the de ired command pattern , like code ign or git. I  hould gather the e unique line  from the relevant file  and  ummarize them in a Se ion - nippet .md under 'Command .' Al o, I'll note u er prompt  related to term  like 'DMG' and 'notarize.' Let'  move forward with thi  plan!
- Here are  ome key point : we need to remember to u e Conventional Commit  with trailer  like Tool, Model, and optional Why, and document any architecture or data  chema change . For unrelea ed change , a bullet in the changelog i  nece ary, along with a  ummary note for u er-vi ible change . We al o have a Commit Policy that  tate  no auto-commit  are allowed; the u er mu t explicitly  ay "commit." 
- I’m focu ing on implementing bru h interaction  for the u er interface. Thi  include  toggle  for mode  like Paint and Era e. When in the e mode , a new  troke begin  on pointer down, recording DayID  vi ited until the u er relea e  the pointer, which then commit  the  troke. The  tructure include  a Highlight Store for color  and day mapping .

## October 2025

- Preferences: Fixed pane width/jumps when switching to Codex CLI and Claude Code tabs; reorganized Usage Tracking rows and moved "Refresh Now" next to Monochrome.
- Unified and Claude windows now honor General â†’ Theme and Modified Date preferences (Unified previously ignored these).

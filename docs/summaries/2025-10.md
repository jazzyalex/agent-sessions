# October 2025 Summary
  
- Fixed Codex usage reset times flagged as “Stale data” by anchoring deltas to `captured_at` and accepting absolute reset timestamps; added flexible timestamp decoding to handle old/new JSON shapes.
- Fix: Split divider position now persists per orientation between launches and no longer shifts during refreshes or UI toggles.
- UX: Eliminated post-launch animation divider jump by normalizing pane constraints and applying saved absolute pixel sizes early.
- Fix: Transcript pane now follows system Light/Dark changes when Appearance is set to System; previously it could remain in Dark after switching to Light.
- Fix: Unified search now returns complete results immediately without waiting for the SQLite index and shows progress feedback while scanning.

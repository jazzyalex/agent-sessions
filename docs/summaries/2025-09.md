# September 2025 Summary

- Rebranded the macOS app to Agent Sessions (formerly CodexHistory), updating bundle identifiers and Xcode targets.
- Added plain transcript view with find/copy and whole‑session raw/pretty sheet.
- Introduced transcript builder (plain/ANSI/attributed) with chunk coalescing; improved parsing and filters.
- Change: Cmd‑C now copies only the selected text in the transcript pane; use the toolbar Copy button or Cmd‑Shift‑C (Copy Transcript) to copy the entire transcript.
- Simplified UI: Removed model/date/kind filters from the main toolbar; moved kind selection to Preferences; added preference to hide sessions with zero messages (on by default).
 - UI polish: Removed duplicate sidebar toggle icon (titlebar only); search and find fields now have clickable magnifying‑glass buttons; gear toolbar icon opens Settings.
- Preferences: Switched to a dedicated Preferences window controller for reliable opening via toolbar gear and Cmd-,; aligned layout with labeled rows and group boxes.
 - Preferences UI: Rebuilt as a sidebar-based layout with flat, grouped sections; removed heavy card frames and placeholder panels.
 - Preferences: Window title set to “Preferences”; refined spacing and footer (Reset/Apply), no behavior changes.
 - Docs: Added `docs/codex-resume.md` describing `--resume/--continue`, global scope (not repo‑scoped), picker paging (25/page with a 100‑file scan cap), filename‑timestamp sorting, preview logic, and the `experimental_resume` launch override; cross‑linked from the session storage doc.
- Fixed file access issue by removing app sandbox; documented benign debug console messages (ViewBridge, Metal library) that appear during normal operation.

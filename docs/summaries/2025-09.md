# September 2025 Summary

- Added plain transcript view with find/copy and whole‑session raw/pretty sheet.
- Introduced transcript builder (plain/ANSI/attributed) with chunk coalescing; improved parsing and filters.
- Change: Cmd‑C now copies only the selected text in the transcript pane; use the toolbar Copy button or Cmd‑Shift‑C (Copy Transcript) to copy the entire transcript.
- Simplified UI: Removed model/date/kind filters from the main toolbar; moved kind selection to Preferences; added preference to hide sessions with zero messages (on by default).

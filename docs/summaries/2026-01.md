## January 2026

- Appearance: Added a toolbar button to toggle Dark/Light mode and View menu actions for Toggle Dark/Light and Use System Appearance.
- Preferences: Added Security & Privacy and License links in Settings → About.
- Preferences: Made the Settings → About updates section more compact.
- Preferences: Updated the Droid pane with binary detection and version check controls.
- Copilot: Tool output now renders escaped newlines as real newlines.
- Search: Added SQLite full-text indexing for faster global search after analytics indexing completes.
- Search: Global search now continues scanning large tool outputs in the background after showing indexed results (can be disabled in Settings → Advanced).
- Search: Instant search now falls back to legacy matching for sessions not indexed yet, preventing missing results during index warmup.
- Indexing: Analytics refresh is now incremental (skips unchanged files and removes deleted ones), reducing repeated startup work.
- Startup: When Codex sessions are already indexed, the app now shows the hydrated list immediately while scanning for newly created sessions in the background.
- Search: Incremental refresh now backfills missing per-session search data so Instant search becomes complete over time.
- Search: Instant indexing now captures more of long tool outputs (head + middle + tail slices) and keeps active Codex sessions searchable while they are updating.
- Sessions: Auto-select the first session on launch so the transcript pane isn’t blank.
- Sessions: Large session message counts no longer jump while background parsing completes.

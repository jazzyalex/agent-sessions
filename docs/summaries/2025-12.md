## December 2025

- Saved Sessions: Saving a session can keep it locally by archiving its source files into Agent Sessions storage and syncing while upstream sessions are still updating, preventing CLI history pruning from removing them.
- Saved Sessions: Added a simple View → Saved Sessions window for listing and managing saved sessions.
- Saved Sessions: Added a “Delete Saved Copies” action to remove local archive copies from the Saved Sessions window.
- Saved Sessions: Fixed archive backfill and Finder reveal actions so saved sessions archive immediately and “Show Saved Copy” works reliably.
- Saved Sessions: Added archive diagnostics (status tooltips and a local archive log) to make saving issues debuggable.
- Keyboard: Improved Tab focus behavior so transcript Find controls don’t enter the Tab chain unless Find is explicitly opened.
- Keyboard: Added Option-Command-Arrow shortcuts to jump between user prompts, tool calls/outputs, and errors in transcripts.
- Transcript (Color view): Increase role contrast and add block spacing so user prompts stand out near tool calls.
- Transcript (Color view): Avoid bold styling for Codex/Droid preamble blocks so system prompts are visually distinct from real user prompts.
- Preferences: Moved Agent Accents (Color/Monochrome) from General to Unified Window.
- Preferences: Add General → Active CLI agents as a global switch that hides disabled agents across Sessions, Analytics, usage strips, and the menu bar, and stops related background work.
- Preferences: Hide the Sessions toolbar Git Context button by default. Re-enable it in Preferences → Advanced.
- Clipboard: Fixed an intermittent issue where the clipboard could be overwritten with a full transcript, causing unexpectedly large pastes in other apps.
- Codex sessions: Respect “Skip Agents.md lines when parsing” for session titles, and jump transcripts to the first prompt with a visible divider while keeping content searchable.
- OpenCode sessions: Fixed missing user/assistant messages in Plain and Color views for OpenCode storage schema `migration=2` by parsing `storage/part/msg_<message-id>/prt_*.json` text parts and mapping them to the correct transcript event types.
- Analytics (Codex): Command counts now include web search and custom tools.
- Gemini sessions: Parse embedded `toolCalls` and treat `type=info` entries as metadata so transcripts and message counts remain stable across newer Gemini CLI versions.
- GitHub Copilot CLI sessions: Import Copilot CLI agent sessions from `~/.copilot/session-state` and include them in Sessions and Analytics, with a dedicated Preferences pane and a toolbar filter (⌘5).
- Droid (Factory CLI) sessions: Import Droid sessions from `~/.factory/sessions` and stream-json logs, with a dedicated Preferences pane and a toolbar filter (⌘6).
- Preferences: Move Saved Sessions settings from Unified Window to Advanced.
- JSON view: Replace extremely large strings (common in tool output) with compact previews so the JSON tab stays responsive and doesn’t truncate entire sessions.
- Claude sessions: Split embedded `thinking` and tool blocks (`tool_use`/`tool_result`) into separate events to keep transcripts faithful as Claude Code evolves.
- Claude sessions (errors): Surface runtime-ish tool failures as errors (non-zero exit, generic `Error: ...`, interrupted runs) while suppressing user-rejected tool uses by default.
- Claude sessions (errors): Avoid false-positive error coloring for read-file tool output that includes “exit code” in numbered source listings.
- Saved Sessions: “Delete Saved Copies” moves local archive copies to the Trash and asks for confirmation.
- Saved Sessions: Starred-session archive backfill now falls back to resolving upstream session files directly when index metadata is missing, so saved copies are created reliably.
- Saved Sessions: Pinning a session no longer performs disk IO on the main thread, reducing UI hitches.
- Onboarding: Added a full onboarding tour for fresh installs and a skippable update tour that appears once per major/minor update (starting in 2.9). Both can be reopened from the Help menu.
- Onboarding: Agent Sessions 2.9.0 includes a Christmas Edition onboarding skin and a festive loading greeting.
- Onboarding: Refined the “Connect your agents” tour step with a centered supported-agents layout.
- Onboarding: Updated tour slides to include Droid (Factory CLI) support and the current agent lineup.

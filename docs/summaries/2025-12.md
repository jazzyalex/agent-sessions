## December 2025

- Preferences: Moved Agent Accents (Color/Monochrome) from General to Unified Window.
- Preferences: Add General → Active CLI agents as a global switch that hides disabled agents across Sessions, Analytics, usage strips, and the menu bar, and stops related background work.
- Preferences: Hide the Sessions toolbar Git Context button by default. Re-enable it in Preferences → Advanced.
- Clipboard: Fixed an intermittent issue where the clipboard could be overwritten with a full transcript, causing unexpectedly large pastes in other apps.
- Codex sessions: Respect “Skip Agents.md lines when parsing” for session titles, and jump transcripts to the first prompt with a visible divider while keeping content searchable.
- OpenCode sessions: Fixed missing user/assistant messages in Plain and Color views for OpenCode storage schema `migration=2` by parsing `storage/part/msg_<message-id>/prt_*.json` text parts and mapping them to the correct transcript event types.
- Analytics (Codex): Command counts now include web search and custom tools.
- Gemini sessions: Parse embedded `toolCalls` and treat `type=info` entries as metadata so transcripts and message counts remain stable across newer Gemini CLI versions.
- JSON view: Replace extremely large strings (common in tool output) with compact previews so the JSON tab stays responsive and doesn’t truncate entire sessions.
- Claude sessions: Split embedded `thinking` and tool blocks (`tool_use`/`tool_result`) into separate events to keep transcripts faithful as Claude Code evolves.
- Claude sessions (errors): Surface runtime-ish tool failures as errors (non-zero exit, generic `Error: ...`, interrupted runs) while suppressing user-rejected tool uses by default.
- Claude sessions (errors): Avoid false-positive error coloring for read-file tool output that includes “exit code” in numbered source listings.

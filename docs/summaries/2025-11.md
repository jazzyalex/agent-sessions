## November 2025

- Added Claude Code “Sessions Directory” override in Preferences. Lets users point Agent Sessions at a custom Claude config root; indexer refreshes immediately and defaults to `~/.claude` when cleared.
- Preferences: Consolidated terminal probe controls into a new Usage Probes pane and simplified the Usage Tracking pane. Added explicit enable/disable toggles for Codex and Claude tracking, independent from strip/menu bar visibility.
- Usage Probes: Fixed Codex/Claude cleanup buttons so they keep posting disabled or unsafe notifications and correctly delete Codex probe sessions whose working directory only appears in nested payload JSON.
- Usage (Codex): "Stale data" now shows when rate‑limit info is older than the threshold; token‑only updates and recent UI refreshes no longer hide staleness.
- Usage Tracking: Added per-agent refresh intervals (Codex: 1/5/15m; Claude: 3/15/30m, default 15m) and clarified that Claude `/usage` probes are token-free because they only open the Usage pane.
- Usage Probes: Removed the shared gate/budget limiter so Claude and Codex refreshers honor the selected cadence, and Claude cleanup now double-checks each session file’s working directory and tiny transcript before deletion.
- Analytics: Sessions Over Time and By Agent cards now share a Sessions/Messages toggle so you can swap between conversation counts and total message volume without losing context.
- Analytics: Stat card tooltips now clarify that the ±% change compares against the previous date range.
- Website: Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata now point to the new `AS-social-media.png` preview so sharing the site shows the large social image.
- Preferences → Gemini CLI now detects the npm `gemini` binary via the login-shell PATH fallback so the auto probe behaves like the other CLI integrations.

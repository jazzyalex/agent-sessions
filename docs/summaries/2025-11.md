## November 2025

- Added Claude Code “Sessions Directory” override in Preferences. Lets users point Agent Sessions at a custom Claude config root; indexer refreshes immediately and defaults to `~/.claude` when cleared.
- Preferences: Consolidated terminal probe controls into a new Usage Probes pane and simplified the Usage Tracking pane. Added explicit enable/disable toggles for Codex and Claude tracking, independent from strip/menu bar visibility.
- Usage Probes: Fixed Codex/Claude cleanup buttons so they keep posting disabled or unsafe notifications and correctly delete Codex probe sessions whose working directory only appears in nested payload JSON.
- Usage (Codex): "Stale data" now shows when rate‑limit info is older than the threshold; token‑only updates and recent UI refreshes no longer hide staleness.
 - Usage Tracking: Added per‑agent refresh intervals (Codex: 1/5/15m; Claude: 10/30/60m, default 30m, with note about message cost).
- Analytics: Sessions Over Time and By Agent cards now share a Sessions/Messages toggle so you can swap between conversation counts and total message volume without losing context.
- Analytics: Stat card tooltips now clarify that the ±% change compares against the previous date range.

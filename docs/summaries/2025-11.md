## November 2025

- Added Claude Code “Sessions Directory” override in Preferences. Lets users point Agent Sessions at a custom Claude config root; indexer refreshes immediately and defaults to `~/.claude` when cleared.
- Preferences: Consolidated terminal probe controls into a new Usage Probes pane and simplified the Usage Tracking pane. Added explicit enable/disable toggles for Codex and Claude tracking, independent from strip/menu bar visibility.

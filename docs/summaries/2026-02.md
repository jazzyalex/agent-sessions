## February 2026

- Image Browser: Now supports Claude Code sessions.
- Image Browser: Now supports OpenCode sessions.
- Image Browser: Now supports Gemini and Copilot sessions.
- Image Browser: Added Project and Agent filters, a larger preview pane, and user prompt context for each image when available.
- Image Browser: Caches image indexes and thumbnails for faster open and to avoid reprocessing previously seen sessions.
- Image Browser: Added thumbnail right-click actions and a preview Actions menu for common image actions.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnail click hit-testing is more reliable after scrolling or transcript updates.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnails now open the Image Browser on single click and include an “Open in Image Browser” context menu action.
- Session view: Shift-clicking an inline image no longer opens the Image Browser, preserving selection behavior.
- Session view: Tool outputs (including OpenClaw `{text,type}` block arrays) now preserve formatting and render as plain text.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnails now support Gemini and Copilot sessions.
- Sessions: Added OpenClaw (clawdbot) session support when the OpenClaw/clawdbot CLI is installed; deleted sessions can be shown via an Advanced toggle.
- Image Browser: OpenClaw images require explicitly selecting OpenClaw in the Agent filter; “All Agents” is now “All Coding Agents”.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnails now support OpenClaw sessions, and OpenClaw project metadata stays consistent after opening a session.
- OpenClaw: Session view hides the verbose media-attachment hint text, formats `exec` outputs like shell output (with exit codes), and Image Browser rebuilds stale indexes so images appear.

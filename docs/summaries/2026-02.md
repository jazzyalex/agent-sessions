## February 2026

- Major update: Added OpenClaw sessions (including optional visibility for deleted OpenClaw transcripts).
- Major update: Expanded Images workflows across Session view inline thumbnails and Image Browser.
- Major bug fix: Search is more complete for sessions that previously stayed partially indexed.
- Major bug fix: Reduced Energy Warning spikes with activation-driven refresh and power-aware background behavior.
- Image Browser: Now supports Claude Code sessions.
- Image Browser: Now supports OpenCode sessions.
- Image Browser: Now supports Gemini and Copilot sessions.
- Image Browser: Added Project and Agent filters, a larger preview pane, and user prompt context for each image when available.
- Image Browser: Caches image indexes and thumbnails for faster open and to avoid reprocessing previously seen sessions.
- Image Browser: Added thumbnail right-click actions and a preview Actions menu for common image actions.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnail click hit-testing is more reliable after scrolling or transcript updates.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnails now open the Image Browser on single click and include an “Open in Image Browser” context menu action.
- Session view: Shift-clicking an inline image no longer opens the Image Browser, preserving selection behavior.
- Session view: Tool outputs (including OpenClaw `{text,type}` block arrays) now preserve formatting and render as plain text.
- Session view: Real user prompts now use the same narrative font as other blocks (no custom user-only typeface).
- Session view: User prompt blocks now remove side accent strips, keep inverted contrast in dark mode, and use a dark gray (`white: 0.20`) bubble with white text in light mode.
- Session view: Removed the synthetic “Conversation starts here” divider line for all agents while preserving first-real-prompt auto-jump when preamble skipping is enabled.
- Session view: The Images toolbar pill now shows only the icon and count (no “Images” text label).
- Session view: The Images toolbar pill now always appears and stays disabled until images are detected for the selected session; once available it enables with X/Y count and navigation.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnails now support Gemini and Copilot sessions.
- Sessions: Added OpenClaw (clawdbot) session support when the OpenClaw/clawdbot CLI is installed; deleted sessions can be shown via an Advanced toggle.
- Image Browser: OpenClaw images require explicitly selecting OpenClaw in the Agent filter; “All Agents” is now “All Coding Agents”.
- Session view: Inline image thumbnails now support OpenClaw sessions, and OpenClaw project metadata stays consistent after opening a session.
- OpenClaw: Session view hides the verbose media-attachment hint text, formats `exec` outputs like shell output (with exit codes), and Image Browser rebuilds stale indexes so images appear.
- Performance: Replaced always-on warmup/archive timers with app-activation and event-driven refresh paths to reduce idle battery/CPU wakeups.
- Usage tracking: Claude `/usage` background probing is now AC-only; battery and Low Power Mode use manual refresh, while Codex polling remains near-live with cheaper unchanged-file ticks.
- Sessions/Search: While typing in global Search, results now stay on fast indexed paths; pressing Return triggers deep/unindexed scan to avoid long typing-time CPU bursts.
- Sessions/Search: Global Search now avoids generating transcripts on-demand and instead uses cached transcripts when available and raw event fields otherwise to reduce sustained CPU bursts after searches.
- Sessions/Indexing: Codex and Claude transcript prewarm tasks now cancel older runs and cap per-refresh work to reduce sustained post-refresh energy spikes.
- Sessions/Indexing: Deferred non-manual refresh work while the app is inactive; it resumes on foreground activation to reduce background energy warnings.
- Codex Usage: Automatic tmux `/status` fallback probes now run less aggressively (stricter stale/no-recent checks plus longer cooldown) and use lighter log-tail scans.
- Sessions/Search: Codex and Claude refresh now process changed files incrementally in small batches with capped concurrency and low-priority background deferral when inactive or on battery.
- Sessions/Search: Gemini, Copilot, Droid, and OpenClaw now use the same power-aware idle indexing profile behavior (reduced worker pressure and deferred non-critical work when inactive or on battery).
- Preferences: Added an OpenClaw pane after the other agent panes with matching Binary Source and Sessions Directory controls.
- Preferences: Added a divider between Droid and OpenClaw in the sidebar, and added `Update...` actions on each agent pane to detect package manager ownership, check for newer versions, and run updates after confirmation.
- Preferences: Hardened agent update detection by resolving manager binaries from common filesystem paths and inferring npm package IDs from the resolved CLI binary (including OpenClaw/clawdbot).
- Onboarding: Added a first-slide feedback card under the session counters with the public Google Form link and local-only/no-telemetry messaging so users know this is the feedback channel.
- Onboarding: Fixed the final-slide weekly chart overlap, split usage limit tracking into separate Claude/Codex sections, and resized/refined layouts so onboarding slides no longer require scrolling.

## Codex Usage Meter

### Codex OAuth failure cooldown has no user-initiated bypass
- **What:** After a failed usage fetch, `CodexOAuthUsageFetcher` sets a 30-minute
  failure cooldown. `refreshNow` goes through the same gate, so there is no way for
  the user to force a retry. Wi-Fi returning 20 seconds after an offline launch can
  leave the Codex meter dark for up to half an hour unless the CLI-RPC fallback
  happens to rescue it.
- **Where:** `AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexOAuth/CodexOAuthUsageFetcher.swift`
  (~:141-159, the cooldown gate), `refreshNow` in `CodexStatusService.swift`.
- **Fix shape:** bypass the failure cooldown for user-initiated refreshes, and
  ideally reset it on a network-path change (NWPathMonitor) so recovery is
  automatic rather than merely possible.
- **Why deferred (2026-08-01):** pre-existing, untouched by the 2026-08-01 meter
  work, and it deserves its own change with tests rather than an addendum to a long
  session. **This is the largest remaining real defect in Codex cold-start
  behaviour** — bigger than the snapshot persistence that was dropped in its favour.

### `.idle` can mislabel a cold-start transient failure
- **What:** `CodexUsageModel.handleAuthFetchResult` promotes `.ok` → `.idle`
  ("No active Codex session") when a completed fetch returned nothing and nothing
  has ever been applied. `CodexUsageFetchResult.transient` covers offline, 5xx AND
  429 alike, so a cold launch during a rate-limit window reads "no active session"
  when the truth is "rate limited, retrying — no session needed".
- **Where:** `AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexStatusService.swift` (the promotion
  before `applyAuthState`), `QuotaData.codex(from:)` in
  `AgentSessions/Views/CockpitFooterView.swift:159-176` (passes neither
  `dataIsStale` nor `transientReason`, unlike `claude(from:)`).
- **Fix shape:** carry a reason on `.transient`, plus a latch — follow-up ticks
  return `.skippedCooldown`, which would otherwise flip the caption back — then make
  the promotion reason-aware. Best done together with the cooldown item above.
- **Why deferred (2026-08-01):** requires a three-way conjunction (cold launch AND
  no rollout from today/yesterday AND a transient first fetch), self-heals on the
  next success, and **no 429 has ever been observed on the Codex endpoint** (the
  documented 429 storms were Claude's edge). Also strictly better than the infinite
  "reconnecting…" spinner it replaced. Revisit only if a Codex-side 429 is actually
  seen.

### Two smaller findings from the same review
- `.idle` does not reset `AuthStatusNotifier`'s one-shot episode where `.ok` did
  (`AgentSessions/Shared/AuthStatusNotifier.swift:43-46`), so a second genuine
  sign-out within one run could go unnotified.
- `UsageMenuBar` renders a moon glyph for Codex idle, but the dropdown's idle
  explainer is Claude-only (Codex rows go through `codexResetMenuTitle`), so the
  glyph has no explanation anywhere in the menu.

## Claude Cloud Sessions

### Reconsider the surface: presence badge instead of runway rows
- **What:** Cloud sessions currently render as rows inside the Quota Meter's runway
  block, with the literal "Cloud" where a rate would be. **The owner questioned
  whether this belongs there at all, and the question is a good one.** Runway's
  grammar is rate-per-session — every row answers "how fast is this eating my
  budget?" A cloud row answers "unknown", takes a slot in a consumption-ranked list,
  and cannot be acted on (no reveal, no navigation, no resume).
- **Decisive argument:** cloud sessions bill the same account-level quota, so the
  Claude 5h/weekly figures **already include them**. Nothing is missing from the
  measurement. What is missing is only awareness — "something is running over
  there" — which is a presence signal, not a metering one.
- **Evidence it is the wrong container:** the friction during implementation
  (slot competition, an empty progress bar, a pseudo-rate label, three rounds of
  ordering corrections) is what happens when an object is put into a container whose
  language it cannot speak.
- **Proposed shape:** a compact indicator on the Claude provider row — e.g.
  `⛅ 2 cloud · 1 working` — outside the consumption ranking. Keeps the awareness
  value, frees the 4 detail slots for rows that carry real rates, removes the
  pseudo-rate and empty bar, and makes the ordering question disappear.
- **Cost to switch:** small. The endpoint, filter, catalog and live model all stand
  unchanged; only `appendingClaudeCloudRows` and the `RunwayAttributionConfidence
  .cloud` case (~80 lines) would be replaced.
- **Sizing input:** the account has 6 cloud sessions total and 0-2 live at any time,
  which argues for a low-weight affordance rather than rows.
- **Also unresolved if rows are kept:** the pinned window's hard 270pt cap
  (`limitsRowHeight × limitsMaximumRows`) has no scrolling, so a saturated panel
  clips silently; and with 4+ local sessions burning, cloud rows lose every detail
  slot and are not counted in the "+N sessions" summary either, so a live cloud
  session can go invisible on a busy day.
- **Why deferred (2026-08-01):** a design decision, deliberately not made at the end
  of a long session. Nothing shipped is stranded by it.

## Usage Tracking

### Verify the Claude Web API usage source actually works
- **What:** The Web API fallback (`claudeWebApiEnabled`; "Web API only" mode) is
  implemented — `ClaudeWebUsageClient.swift` + `ClaudeWebCookieResolver.swift`
  (reads the Safari claude.ai session cookie) — but has **never been observed
  serving data at runtime**. The source diagnostic has only ever shown OAuth;
  the CLI OAuth path recovers first and masks it.
- **How to prove:** set Claude Data source → "Web API only" (forces the path),
  reload, confirm the source flips to a web source and serves numbers, then
  restore Auto.
- **Caveats:** needs Safari signed into claude.ai; Full Disk Access is per-binary
  (the grant is on the production build, not the `.deriveddata-run` debug build) —
  so test from the production build, or grant FDA to the test binary.
- **Why deferred (2026-07-10):** owner skipped the live test; normal (OAuth) auth
  is fixed and sufficient for now.

## Transcript (Session view)

### Semantic filters (Plan / Code / Diff / Review) in the Session view
- **First, validate demand — do NOT build on assumption.** The old Terminal view
  had semantic toggles alongside the role toggles; when Terminal was retired only
  the role filters (You/Agent/Tools/Errors) were restored (2026-07-06). Before
  porting semantic filters, confirm they're actually used/wanted — check whether
  anyone relied on "show only code / only diffs / only plans / only reviews", vs.
  role filters + ⌘F covering the real need. If demand is thin, close as WON'T-DO.
- **Where:** filter bar lives in
  [TranscriptPlainView.swift](../AgentSessions/Views/TranscriptPlainView.swift)
  (`sessionRoleFilterBar`); block filtering in
  [TranscriptBlockListView.swift](../AgentSessions/Views/TranscriptBlockListView.swift)
  (`TranscriptRoleFilter`, `applyingRoleFilter`, `matchesUnderActiveRoleFilter`).
  Terminal reference: `SessionTerminalView.swift` `SemanticKind` +
  `semanticFilteredLines` (per-LINE `line.semanticKind`).
- **Why deferred / why it's harder than roles:** roles map 1:1 to
  `LogicalBlock.Kind`, so filtering is a clean block-level predicate. Semantic
  kinds were computed **per line** in Terminal (a single assistant block mixes
  prose + code fences + diffs). Blocks carry no per-block semantic label, so this
  needs either (a) a new per-block semantic classification pass, or (b) sub-block
  (per-run) filtering — both materially larger and with more regression surface in
  the perf-sensitive windowed list. Est. 3–5× the role-filter work.
- **Decision (2026-07-06):** deferred; owner asked to backlog AND to verify need
  before committing to the port. Related: [[project_transcript_redesign_phase01_state]].

## QM / Runway

### Runway overflow "+X sessions" undercount (`withPendingRows`)
- **Where:** `RunwaySnapshotAssembly.withPendingRows` —
  [CodexRunwayModel.swift:344](../AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexRunwayModel.swift:344),
  `burstSummary: existing.burstSummary ?? pendingSummary`.
- **What:** When ≥ `maxRows` sessions are actively burning (so `snapshot()` already
  produced a full row set + a burn `burstSummary`) *and* extra active-but-not-burning
  sessions exist, those extras become `pendingIdentities`, get summarized, and are then
  discarded by `??`. The drawer's "+X sessions" counts only the hidden burns, silently
  omitting the idle actives — displayed count reads lower than the real concurrency.
- **Verified:** pure undercount, not a double-count (`burstSummary != nil` ⟹
  `rows.count == maxRows` ⟹ `openSlots == 0`, so no pending row overlaps the burns).
- **Fix:** merge the counts (`existing.burstSummary.count + hiddenPendingCount`),
  keeping the burn summary's rate/deadline (pending contributes 0 / `.unavailable`).
- **Decision (2026-07-03):** **Fold into the single-orphan Runway change**, not shipped
  standalone. Same function is rewritten there; needs its own test + a small
  rate-ownership decision. Low severity, rare trigger (≥ `maxRows` burning + ≥ 1 idle in
  one provider). Spec: [qm-runway-single-orphan-session-spec.md](qm-runway-single-orphan-session-spec.md) → Appendix A.
- **DONE (2026-07-09):** shipped with the single-orphan promotion — `withPendingRows`
  now merges `burnSummary.count + pendingIdentities.count` (burn summary keeps
  rate/deadline). Test: `testRunwayPendingOverflowMergesWithBurnSummaryCount`.

### Runway "pause impact" projection is modeled but never displayed
- **Where:** [CodexRunwayModel.swift](../AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexRunwayModel.swift) —
  `RunwayPauseImpactRow.deadline` / `.gainedSeconds`, the `RunwayDeadline` enum
  ([:11](../AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexRunwayModel.swift:11)), `deadline()`
  ([:512](../AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexRunwayModel.swift:512)), `gainedSeconds()`
  ([:521](../AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexRunwayModel.swift:521)),
  `minimumDisplayedGain`.
- **What:** The model computes, per session, "if you paused this, your quota would run
  out at X instead of Y — you'd gain N minutes" (`.afterReset` / `.runout(Date)` /
  `.noChange`). No view reads `.deadline` or `.gainedSeconds`; `runwayRow` renders only
  name + burn rate + load bar. The sole live consumer is the pressure-branch sort key
  `gainedSeconds` ([:447](../AgentSessions/CodexStatus/CodexRunwayModel.swift:447)); the
  values themselves are never shown.
- **Nature:** latent designed-but-unwired feature, **not a bug**. Cheap to leave.
- **Options:** (a) **surface** it — a small "→ reset" / "+Nm" badge in the row (answers
  "which session do I pause to survive to reset?"); (b) **trim** it — switch the sort to
  `normalizedRate` (already used by the after-reset branch) and delete
  deadline/gainedSeconds/`RunwayDeadline`/`minimumDisplayedGain`; (c) leave as-is.
- **Decision:** open — pending product call on whether the impact number is worth showing.

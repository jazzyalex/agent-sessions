# Agent Support Docs

Start here for how Agent Sessions tracks supported agent versions and parsing compatibility.

## What lives where
- Support matrix: `docs/agent-support/agent-support-matrix.yml`
- Support ledger (append-only, from now on): `docs/agent-support/agent-support-ledger.yml`
- Workflow: `docs/agent-support/workflow.md`
- Monitoring (daily/weekly): `docs/agent-support/monitoring.md`
- Update checklist: `docs/agent-support/update-checklist.md`
- Memory bank: `docs/agent-json-tracking.md`

## Quick usage
1. Read the workflow.
2. Use the update checklist before changing the matrix.
3. Record every upstream check in the memory bank.
4. Run monitoring (daily/weekly) to detect drift early.

### Added

- Unified window for Codex + Claude with a source toggle (Both / Codex / Claude).
- Claude Code support: parsing, transcript rendering, unique usage tracking (5h/weekly), and Resume for Claude sessions (Terminal/iTerm, configurable in Preferences).
- Inline toolbar Search: magnifying‑glass button expands to a field; Option+Command+F opens and focuses it instantly.
- Search progress strip under the sessions table showing phase and counters.
- Context menu action: Open Session in Folder for quick file reveal (works even when Finder hides system files).

### Changed

- Search v2: cancellable, incremental, two‑phase pipeline (small files first; large deferred), no preview text, and strict source toggle enforcement.
- Default display for not‑yet‑loaded sessions shows file size in the Msgs column (instead of “Many”).
- Exclude filters in Preferences now apply instantly (no app reload); “Skip agents.md lines” enabled by default for titles/initial view.
- Titles and transcript start skip common preambles (agents.md and Claude “Caveat …” blocks); auto‑scroll jumps to the first conversational line.

### Improved

- Large session performance: lazy hydration, off‑main parsing, and defer‑until‑needed loading for ≥10 MB logs.
- Unified search UX: batch streaming of results, keystrokes cancel immediately, and promote‑on‑open prioritizes a clicked large session.
- Focus and keyboard flow: inline search auto‑focuses on open and collapses when empty on click/tab away; no unexpected focus steals from the list.
- Visual polish: tighter spacing and aligned usage strips and progress meters.

### Fixed

- Prevented Find field from stealing focus when navigating the list.
- More reliable selection behavior during initial load and when switching rows.
- Finder reveal works for hidden session files.

### Documentation

- Updated v2 notes and UI tooltips across Sessions, Transcript, and Preferences to clarify behaviors (including Transcript vs Terminal and all Find controls).

### UI

- Inline search with a clear button that cancels search and collapses back to the magnifying‑glass.
- Compact progress line communicates “Scanning small/large … x/y” during searches.
